# Python basics

This repository has all-in-one [main.py](./main.py) that demos basic data structures, syntax, style and features of python programming language 3.x

```sh
# if you want to run it (to make sure it all valid)
python3 main.py
```

In case you want to see similar layout in other language (for side-by-side
comparison):
- [Java](https://github.com/antontsv/java-basics)
- [Go](https://github.com/antontsv/go-basics)

## Reasons

I switch between different languages often.

Main reason I have created this file is to serve as a quick refresher or cheat sheet for python.

Most high-level languages have similar features: variables, common data types, conditional statements, loops, functions.

Yes, there are a ton of cheat sheets in existence:
- some are just lacking examples
- others describe each piece on separate page (just to show ads)
- some are way too long

This is format I believe covers a bit of everything.
